    <p><strong>Not who I am, but kind of:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grew up in Maryland</li>
      <li>GenZ</li>
      <li>Founded Orpheus Technologies at 20, dropped out at 21 because it actually worked. Now Orpheus AI</li>
      <li>Then started Enotrium</li>
      <li>Half Californian, half Washingtonian</li>
      <li>Working on modeling the nature of the universe</li>
      <li>Testing toxins in soil and produce roots</li>
      <li>Only listen to podcasts and audiobooks (no pop music)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Things I think:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the Founders were alive today, they would declare independence from the military industrial complex</li>
      <li>Technology is inherently transhumanist and centralizing, even if decentralizing is in your deck</li>
      <li>Agriculture built civilization</li>
      <li>The earliest iterations on technology are for farming</li>
      <li>Nature is embedded with its own energy conversion mechanisms, which is almost always more effective than human-made energy</li>
      <li>Literature slaps!</li>
      <li>It's much easier to work when you see life as it truly is</li>
      <li>I try to think fast and talk slow</li>
      <li>Hamlet is the greatest work of art ever produced</li>
      <li>The Brothers Karamazov converted me to Christianity</li>
      <li>Nothing is learned which does not come from necessity</li>
      <li>I taught myself to code when I wanted software to create a specific outcome in my life, not because software has some intrinsic end</li>
      <li>Deep focus creates talent, the mind reinvents itself with a purpose</li>
      <li>Expertise is a defense/survival mechanism</li>
      <li>Language conceals more than it reveals</li>
      <li>AGI is a lie</li>
      <li>ASI canâ€™t outwit Shakespeare</li>
      <li>Humans are a microcosm of the earth: if I have a microbiome, the soil has a microbiome</li>
      <li>AI will destroy the knowledge economy</li>
      <li>The earth belongs to those who protect it, the future belongs to those who take it</li>
      <li>Farmers deserve the land</li>
      <li>Industrial farming destroys biodiversity</li>
      <li>Everyone building companies in agriculture is wrong about everything</li>
      <li>Entrepreneurship is an arbitrage trade</li>
      <li>The world has a defined upside, often missed and always variable, that requires x inputs to realize it</li>
      <li>Entrepreneurial labor and technological invention is useless if unconfigured to human realities</li>
      <li>The best investors are founders who never sell</li>
      <li>Descriptions of founding a company have nothing to do with actually doing it</li>
      <li>The future is agrarian</li>
      <li>With technology, forever chemicals are not forever</li>
      <li>Technology made from scratch is useless compared to technology that harnesses physical properties of nature</li>
