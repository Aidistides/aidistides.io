  <div class="Not who I am, but kind of:
Grew up in Maryland
GenZ
Founded Orpheus Technologies at 20, dropped out at 21 because it actually worked. Now Orpheus AI
Then started Enotrium
Half Californian, half Washingtonian
Working on modeling the nature of the universe
Testing toxins in soil and produce roots
Only listen to podcasts and audiobooks (no pop music)
Things I think:
If the Founders were alive today, they would declare independence from the military industrial complex
Technology is inherently transhumanist and centralizing, even if decentralizing is in your deck
Agriculture built civilization
The earliest iterations on technology are for farming
Nature is embedded with its own energy conversion mechanisms, which is almost always more effective than human made energy
Literature slaps!
It's much easier to work when you see life as it truly is
I try to think fast and talk slow
Hamlet is the greatest work of art ever produced
The Brothers Karamazov converted me to Christianity
Nothing is learned which does not come from necessity
I taught myself to code when I wanted software to create a specific outcome in my life, not because software has some intrinsic end or I applied some abstract value to learning to code
Deep focus creates talent, the mind reinvents itself with a purpose
Expertise is a defense/survival mechanism
Language conceals more than it reveals
AGI is a lie 
ASI canâ€™t outwit Shakespeare
Humans are a microcosm of the earth: If i have a microbiome, the soil has a microbiome
AI will destroy the knowledge economy
The earth belongs to those who protect it, the future belongs to those who take it
Farmers deserve the land
Industrial Farming destroys biodiversity 
Everyone building companies in agriculture is wrong about everything
Entrepreneurship is an arbitrage trade
The world has a defined upside, often missed and always variable, that requires x inputs to realize it  
Entrepreneurial labor and technological invention is useless if unconfigured to human realities
The best investors are founders who never sell
Descriptions of founding a company have nothing to do with actually doing it
The Future is Agrarian
With technology, forever chemicals are not forever
Technology made from scratch is useless compared to technology that harnesses physical properties of nature
